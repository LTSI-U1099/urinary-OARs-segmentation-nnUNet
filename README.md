# urinary-OARs-segmentation-nnUNet
This repository hosts the code, trained models, and scripts for a deep learning method based on nnU-Net, designed for automatic segmentation of urinary organs at risk (OARs) and pelvic structures on multicentric prostate MRI. This repository accompanies an ongoing, under-review study and does not yet correspond to a final, published article.
